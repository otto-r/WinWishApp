# WinWishApp

A project I'm doing with a friend, to learn more about building larger and more complex programs.
Working together to coordinate while building separate applications communicating with a server/database.

Wish list application for testing/proof of concept. Users may create wish lists which contain items.
These lists can be shared among users.

Server is a Raspberry Pi with MySQL and PHP.

Built to test and construct the architecture of the database.

Future concerns:
  - Security and safekeeping of data and communication between client and server
